**A Day of Car Racing** \
Larry and four friends went to the racetrack to witness the big car race held this past weekend. Five different contenders sped their way around the track to victory, or defeat. The race ended with no major crashes and an exciting dead heat to the finish line. The five friends had such a good time, they made arrangements right on the spot to return the following month for the next big race. Determine the first and last name of each driver in the race, the sponsor for each race car, and in what position each driver ended the race.

1. The driver sponsored by Flash Automotive finished the race in third place. Howard, who wasn't sponsored by Crank Motor Oil, didn't finish the race in fifth place. 
2. Ryan, whose last name wasn’t Right, wasn’t sponsored by NAPA Auto Parts. Barry Straight wasn’t sponsored by Fleet Bodyworks.
3. The driver sponsored by Crank Motor Oil placed one position higher than Sydney, whose last name wasn’t Element.
4. Mr. Chariot, whose first name wasn’t Adam, finished in first place. Howard placed one position lower than Mr. Right.
5. NAPA Auto Parts sponsored the driver who finished in fourth place, which wasn’t Barry.
